# Advent of Code 2015

## My solutions

This is just my try at solving the coding challenges of Advent of Code, 2015. It is currently a work in progress and I am not sure I can finish all of the challenges, considering it gets quite hard at around day 09.
I still try to solve as many as I can because it is fun and it is a good tool for learning new programming languages. I currently am using Advent of Code 2015 to try to learn, or at least getting more familiar with C++.

So because I am but a C++ newbie, and not a particularly exceptional programmer, code in here could be ugly, unoptimized or at sometimes, just dumb. Please be understanding.

### Update 08 Jun.
Started work on Day11. At first glance, it doesn't seem too hard. We'll see...

### Update 07 Jun. Moving on to Day11
Day10 caused me some problems, tried many approaches but was not successfull. In the end, I decided for a pretty straightforward implementation of simply iterating through a string and counting characters. Makes me feel like I picked a silly approach that doesn't allow me to show off skills or use more complex tools, but at least it gets the job done. Only bad thing is it took me two days to get to this apparently very simple solution. Whatever, moving on to next day...
