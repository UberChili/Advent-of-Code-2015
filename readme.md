# Advent of Code 2015

## My solutions

This is just my try at solving the coding challenges of Advent of Code, 2015. It is currently a work in progress and I am not sure I can finish all of the challenges, considering it gets quite hard at around day 09.
I still try to solve as many as I can because it is fun and it is a good tool for learning new programming languages. I currently am using Advent of Code 2015 to try to learn, or at least getting more familiar with C++.

So because I am but a C++ newbie, and not a particularly exceptional programmer, code in here could be ugly, unoptimized or at sometimes, just dumb. Please be understanding.

### Update 29 May
Forgot to update this. Managed to finish Day7 some days ago. It was a lot of trouble but in the end the fix wasn't that hard to implement. Have rested a little since then but it's getting time to start working again, need to start Day8 soon.
